# Sources — Swift source

## Purpose

Owns SwiftPM application/library source code.

## Ownership

- `FlowState`

## Local Contracts

- Preserve SwiftPM structure and current app architecture.
- Keep UI behavior installable and testable, not demo-only.
- Do not introduce cloud/accounts/telemetry unless explicitly requested.

## Work Guidance

- Read this file after the root `AGENTS.md` before editing this subtree.
- Prefer extending existing modules/files over creating parallel duplicate systems.
- Update this `AGENTS.md` only when durable ownership, contracts, or verification guidance changes.

## Verification

- `swift test` when code/tests change.
- `swift build` when app source changes.

## Child DOX Index

None.
